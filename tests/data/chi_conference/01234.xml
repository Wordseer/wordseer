<abstract>In this paper, we propose a new technique based on recent neuroimaging studies as a tool for the assessment of interactive systems. For this purpose, we analyze the mental process that takes place while human subjects learn to use new tools by using two different approaches. One is an experiment on task performance based on the conventional direct testing method of a user interface, and the other is an indirect method based on recent neuroimaging studies that indirectly estimate the process of interaction through the observation of the human brain activities. The results obtained from the direct experiment on performance evaluation are compared with those from the indirect analysis of the human brain activity, which is measured by a non-invasive neuroimaging measuring method. The process of acquisition of internal models while subjects learn to use new tools is also discussed.</abstract>
