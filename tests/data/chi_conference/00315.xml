<abstract>How do people use an enterprise file-sharing service? We describe patterns of usage in a social file-sharing service that was deployed in a large multinational enterprise. Factor analyses revealed four factors: <b>Upload \&#38; Publicize</b> (regarding one's own files); <b>Annotate \&#38; Watch</b> (add information to files and maintain awareness); <b>Discover \&#38; Tell</b> (find files uploaded by other users, and communicate to additional users about those files); and <b>Refind</b> (re-use one's own files). We explore the attributes of users who score highly on each of these factors, and we propose implications for design to encourage innovation in usage.</abstract>
