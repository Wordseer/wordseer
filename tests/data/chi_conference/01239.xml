<abstract>Our goal is to help automate the capture and broadcast of lectures to remote audiences. There are two inter-related components to the design of such systems. The technology component includes the hardware (e.g., video cameras) and associated software (e.g., speaker-tracking). The aesthetic component embodies the rules and idioms that human videographers follow to make a video visually engaging. We present a lecture room automation system and a substantial number of new video-production rules obtained from professional videographers who critiqued it. We also describe rules for a variety of lecture room environments differing in the numbers and types of cameras. We further discuss gaps between what professional videographers do and what is technologically feasible today.</abstract>
