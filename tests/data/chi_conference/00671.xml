<abstract>Motion-detection only games have inherent limitations on game experience in that the systems cannot identify the player's existence and identity. A way of improvement is by introducing information such as a player's face or head into the system. We designed and implemented two game prototypes that apply real-time face position information as intrinsic elements of gameplay to enhance game experience. The first prototype augmented a typical motion-detection-based game. Face information was designed to enhance the sense of presence and role-playing. In the second prototype, face tracking is applied as a new axis of control in a First Person Shooter (FPS) game.Although Face detection and tracking technology has started utilizing in game scenarios, there was little systematic research on how user experience is leveraged by applying face information to video games. The results of our user tests on comparing camera-based video games with and without face tracking demonstrated that using face position information can effectively enhance presence and role-playing. In addition, an intuitive control that augmented by face-tracking in the FPS game also got positive feedbacks from the test.</abstract>
