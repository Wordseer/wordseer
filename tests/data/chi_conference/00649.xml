<abstract>We propose a method of measuring people's sense of presence in computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems) based on linguistic features of their dialogues. We create variations in presence by asking participants to collaborate on physical tasks in four CMC conditions. We then correlate self-reported feelings of presence with the use of specific linguistic features. Regression analyses show that 30\% of the variance in self-reported presence can be accounted for by a small number of task-independent linguistic features. Even better prediction can be obtained when self-reported coordination is added to the regression equation. We conclude that linguistic measures of presence have value for studies of CMC.</abstract>
