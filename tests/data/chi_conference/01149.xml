<abstract>In this paper, we describe an interface for browsing and skipping digital video content in a consumer setting; that is, sitting and watching television from a couch using a standard remote control. We compare this interface with two other interfaces that are in common use today and found that subjective satisfaction was statistically better with the new interface. Performance metrics however, like time to task completion and number of clicks were worse.</abstract>
