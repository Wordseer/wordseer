<abstract>As statistical machine learning algorithms and techniques continue to mature, many researchers and developers see statistical machine learning not only as a topic of expert study, but also as a tool for software development. Extensive prior work has studied software development, but little prior work has studied software developers applying statistical machine learning. This paper presents interviews of eleven researchers experienced in applying statistical machine learning algorithms and techniques to human-computer interaction problems, as well as a study of ten participants working during a five-hour study to apply statistical machine learning algorithms and techniques to a realistic problem. We distill three related categories of difficulties that arise in applying statistical machine learning as a tool for software development: (1) difficulty pursuing statistical machine learning as an iterative and exploratory process</i>, (2) difficulty understanding</i> relationships between data and the behavior of statistical machine learning algorithms, and (3) difficulty evaluating</i> the performance of statistical machine learning algorithms and techniques in the context of applications. This paper provides important new insight into these difficulties and the need for development tools that better support the application of statistical machine learning.</abstract>
