<abstract>The research area of Single Display Groupware (SDG) confronts the standard model of computing interaction, one user working on one computer, by investigating how the best support groups of users interacting with a shared display. One problem that has arisen in SDG research concerns access to private information. Previously, private information could not be displayed on a shared display, it could only be accessed on external devices, such as private monitors or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). This paper discusses Single Display Privacyware (SDP), an interaction technique that allows private information to be shown within the context of a shared display. A description of the hardware and software components of our prototype SDP system is given, as are the results of a user study  performed to investigate users interacting in the environment. Conclusions concerning future research in the area of SDP are discussed.</abstract>
