<abstract>This paper describes some of the consumer-driven usability research conducted by NCR Self Service Strategic Solutions in the development of an understanding of usability and user acceptance of leading-edge biometrics verification techniques. We discuss biometric techniques in general and focus upon the usability phases and issues, associated with iris verification technology at the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) user interface. The paper concludes with a review of some of the major research issues encountered, and an outline of future work in the area.</abstract>
