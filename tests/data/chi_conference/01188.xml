<abstract>The majority of systems using public displays to foster awareness have focused on providing information across remote locations or among people who are loosely connected and lack awareness of each other's activities or interests. We have, however, identified many potential benefits for an awareness system that displays information within a small, co-located group in which the members already possess some awareness of each other's activities. By using "Semi-Public Displays," public displays scoped for small groups, we can make certain types of information visible in the environment, promoting collaboration and providing lightweight information about group activity. Compared to designing for large, loosely connected groups, designing for Semi-Public Displays mitigates typically problematic issues in sustaining relevant content for the display and minimizing privacy concerns. We are using these applications to support and enhance the interactions and information that group members utilize to maintain awareness and collaborate.</abstract>
