<abstract>There is a lack of widely-accepted metrics for evaluating analysts' experiences with interactive visualizations (IV) for information analysis. We report an approach for developing analyst-centered IV metrics that is built upon understanding the workplace needs and experiences of information analysts with respect to IVs. We derive metrics from human-computer interaction heuristics, specializing the metrics to address the characteristics of IVs and analysts. When there are no existing heuristics, analysts' needs and experiences inform new heuristics.</abstract>
