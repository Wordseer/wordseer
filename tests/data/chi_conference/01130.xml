<abstract>Today's graphical interactive systems largely depend upon pointing actions, i.e. entering an object and selecting it. In this paper we explore whether an alternate paradigm --- crossing boundaries --- may substitute or complement pointing as another fundamental interaction method. We describe an experiment in which we systematically evaluate two target-pointing tasks and four goal-crossing tasks, which differ by the direction of the movement variability constraint (collinear vs. orthogonal) and by the nature of the action (pointing vs. crossing, discrete vs. continuous). We found that participants' temporal performance in each of the six tasks was dependent on the index of difficulty formulated in the same way as in Fitts' law, but that the parameters differ by task. We also found that goal crossing completion time was shorter or no longer than pointing performance under the same index of difficulty. These regularities, as well as qualitative characterizations of crossing actions and their application in HCI, lay the foundation for designing crossing-based user interfaces</abstract>
