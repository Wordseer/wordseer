<abstract>We present Cued Gaze-Points</i> (CGP) as a shoulder-surfing resistant cued-recall graphical password scheme where users gaze</i> instead of mouse-click. This approach has several advantages over similar eye-gaze systems, including a larger password space and its cued-recall nature that can help users remember multiple distinct passwords. Our 45-participant lab study is the first evaluation of gaze-based password entry via user-selected points on images. CGP's usability is potentially acceptable, warranting further refinement and study.</abstract>
