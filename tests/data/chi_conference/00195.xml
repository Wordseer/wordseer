<abstract>A persona represents a group of target users that share common behavioral characteristics. By using a narrative, picture, and name, a persona provides HCI practitioners with a vivid and specific design target. This research develops a new methodology for the identification and creation of personas through the application of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). An application of the LSA methodology is provided in the context of the design of an Institutional Repository system. The LSA methodology helps overcome some of the drawbacks of current methods for the identification and creation of personas, and makes the process less subjective, more efficient, and less reliant on specialized skills.</abstract>
