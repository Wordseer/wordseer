<abstract>Motivated by and grounded in observations of eye-gaze patterns in human-human dialogue, this study explores using eye-gaze patterns in managing human-computer dialogue. We developed an interactive system, iTourist, for city trip planning, which encapsulated knowledge of eye-gaze patterns gained from studies of human-human collaboration systems. User study results show that it was possible to sense users' interest based on eye-gaze patterns and manage computer information output accordingly. Study participants could successfully plan their trip with iTourist and positively rated their experience of using it. We demonstrate that eye-gaze could play an important role in managing future multimodal human-computer dialogues.</abstract>
