<abstract>To address the needs of cancer patients and their caregivers, Microsoft Research and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center developed HutchWorld, an online community environment, to provide computer-mediated social and informational support. In a controlled clinical study, we deployed HutchWorld to bone marrow transplant patients and their caregivers and assessed the impact of Internet access and HutchWorld on their quality of life. We found that Internet access and the use of HutchWorld helped to buffer study participants against reductions in life satisfaction and social support following the transplant procedure. In particular, participants used the Internet to seek out support from family and friends</abstract>
