<abstract>In this paper, we reflect on the design and deployment process of MAGICBoard, a public display deployed in a university setting that solicits the electronic votes and opinions of bystanders on trivial but amusing topics. We focus on the consequences of our design choices with respect to encouraging bystanders</i> to interact with the public display. Bystanders are individuals around the large display who may never fully engage with the application itself, but are potential contributors</i> to the system. Drawing on our recent experiences with MAGICBoard, we present a classification of bystanders</i>, and then discuss three design themes relevant to the design of systems for bystander use: graduated proximal engagement, lowering barriers for interaction and supporting covert engagement</i>.</abstract>
