<abstract>Unistrokes are a viable form of text input in pen-based user interfaces. However, they are a very heterogeneous group of gestures the only common feature being that all are drawn with a single stroke. Several unistroke alphabets have been proposed including the original Unistrokes, Graffiti, Allegro, T-Cube and MDITIM. Comparing these methods usually requires a lengthy study with many writers and even then the results are biased by the earlier handwriting experience that the writers have. Therefore, a simple descriptive model for predicting the writing time for an expert user on any given unistroke alphabet thus enabling sounder argumentation on the properties of different writing methods.</abstract>
