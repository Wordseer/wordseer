<abstract>Question and answer (Q\&A) sites such as Yahoo! Answers are places where users ask questions and others answer them. In this paper, we investigate predictors of answer quality through a comparative, controlled field study of responses provided across several online Q\&A sites. Along with several quantitative results concerning the effects of factors such as question topic and rhetorical strategy, we present two high-level messages. First, you get what you pay for in Q\&A sites. Answer quality was typically higher in Google Answers (a fee-based site) than in the free sites we studied, and paying more money for an answer led to better outcomes. Second, we find that a Q\&A site's community of users contributes to its success. Yahoo! Answers, a Q\&A site where anybody can answer questions, outperformed sites that depend on specific individuals to answer questions, such as library reference services.</abstract>
