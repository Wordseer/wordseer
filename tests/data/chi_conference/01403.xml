<abstract>Social interface theory has widespread influence in the field of human-computer interaction. The basic thesis is that humanizing cues in a computer interface can engender responses from users similar to human-human interaction. In contrast, the survey interviewing literature suggests that computer administration of surveys on highly sensitive topics reduces or eliminates social desirability effect, even when such humanizing features as voice are used.In attempting to reconcile these apparently contradictory findings, we varied features of the interface in a Web survey (n=3047). In one treatment, we presented an image of 1) a male researcher, 2) a female researcher, or 3) the study logo at several points. In another, we varied the extent of personal feedback provided. We  find little support for the soical interface hypothesis. We describe our study and discuss possible reasons for the contradictory evidence on social interfaces</abstract>
