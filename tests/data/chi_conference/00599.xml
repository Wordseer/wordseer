<abstract>In this paper we describe a new method for doing text input with touch sensitive wheels. The method is called Transparent User guided Prediction (TUP). With TUP all characters are assigned to fixed positions on the wheel. A language prediction algorithm is used to make it easy to select the most likely characters. The use of the prediction algorithm is transparent for the users, which makes the use of TUP very intuitive. A prototype of TUP is evaluated against the date stamp method for doing wheel text input. Text entry speed for TUP is about 6-7 words per minute for novice users. This is approximately 30\% faster than the date stamp method.</abstract>
