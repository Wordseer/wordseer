<abstract>One of the outcomes of massive adoption of technology is that much of daily technology use and consumption is embedded into "unremarkable" daily life routines. Occasionally, these routines undergo major shifts, often in conjunction with major life events such as marriage, birth of a child, or a residential move. We propose a model of settling into a new location as a function of balance between the pull of the things left behind and the demands of the new and unknown. It is through this experience of being unsettled that we explore the processes of behavior adjustment and re-evaluation of old patterns of technology use as it relates to the old location and the demands of the new location.</abstract>
