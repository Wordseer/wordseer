<abstract>Unistrokes</i> and Graffiti</i> are stylus-based text entry techniques. While Unistrokes</i> is recognized in academia, Graffiti</i> is commercially prevalent in PDAs. Though numerous studies have investigated the usability of Graffiti</i>, none exists to compare its long-term performance with that of Unistrokes</i>. This paper presents a longitudinal study comparing entry speed, correction rate, stroke duration, and preparation (i.e., inter-stroke) time of these two techniques. Over twenty fifteen-phrase sessions, performance increased from 4.0 wpm to 11.4 wpm for Graffiti</i> and from 4.1 wpm to 15.8 wpm for Unistrokes</i>. Correction rates were high for both techniques. However, rates for Graffiti</i> remained relatively consistent at 26\%, while those for Unistrokes decreased from 43\% to 16\%.</abstract>
