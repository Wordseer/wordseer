<abstract>We present an overview+detail document interface that draws on perceptual principles to help users work with documents. Central to our approach is the use of improved document overviews. Our approach also includes novel highlighting in the full representation of documents, as well as techniques to help users smoothly transition from the overview to the full representation of the document. We present a specific implementation of our design for Web browsing. We also present a qualitative user study that indicates that our perceptual design principles are effective and that users prefer our interface to traditional "find" and highlighting techniques. Our user study additionally reveals interesting tasks and strategies supported in our framework that have implications for overview+detail document interfaces in general</abstract>
