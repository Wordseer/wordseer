<abstract>We propose a quantitative model for dwell-based eye pointing tasks. Using the concepts of information theory to analogize eye pointing, we define an index of difficulty (ID<sub>eye</sub></i>) for the corresponding tasks in a similar manner to the definition that Fitts made for hand pointing. According to our validations in different situations, ID<sub>eye</sub></i>, which takes account of the distinct characteristics of rapid saccades and involuntary eye jitters, can accurately and meaningfully describe eye pointing tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first successful attempt to model eye gaze interactions.</abstract>
