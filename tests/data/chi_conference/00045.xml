<abstract>We present a method for browsing videos by directly dragging their content. This method brings the benefits of direct manipulation to an activity typically mediated by widgets. We support this new type of interactivity by: 1) automatically extracting motion data from videos; and 2) a new technique called relative flow dragging</i> that lets users control video playback by moving objects of interest along their visual trajectory. We show that this method can outperform the traditional seeker bar in video browsing tasks that focus on visual content rather than time.</abstract>
