<abstract>Human factors professionals have long been challenged with finding an effective way of communicating critical human factors design information to product designers. The authors have created a tool called a ``Knowledge Shelf" for providing human factors information to designers in a very easy to use manner. The Knowledge Shelf is an interactive virtual library of information on human factors methodologies and data relevant to the specific product development needs of designers. Available through the Motorola Intranet, the Knowledge Shelf is designed to make human factors design information easily accessible. Providing these types of information to designers positively impacts the product development process, by facilitating more user-centered design practices.</abstract>
