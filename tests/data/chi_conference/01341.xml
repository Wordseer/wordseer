<abstract>In this paper, we describe how encouraging children to talk to the camera can structure their behavior and provide them opportunity for reflection. Encouraging "camera talk," interactions directed at the camera, can effectively elicit verbal comments from children participants. We describe a study in which children participants were told that they could tell the camera anything they wanted to about the designs they were making using a piece of educational software, but not to behave in a disruptive manner for the camera. By allowing children to interact with the camera in a particular way, rather than encouraging them to ignore its presence, we were able to elicit information about some children's design activities, thoughts, and struggles. The camera became an integral part of the socio-technical system for some children. This method may be useful to researchers interested in what children are thinking about in-the-moment as they work with software.</abstract>
