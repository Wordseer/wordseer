<abstract>Kinetic (dynamic) typography has demonstrated the ability to add significant emotive content and appeal to expressive text, allowing some of the qualities normally found in film and the spoken word to be added to static text. Kinetic typography has been widely and successfully used in film title sequences as well as television and computer-based advertising. However, its communicative abilities have not been widely studied, and its potential has rarely been exploited outside these areas. This is partly due to the difficulty in creating kinetic typography with current tools, often requiring hours of work to animate a single sentence.In this paper, we present the Kinedit system, a basic authoring tool that takes initial steps toward remedying this situation and hence promoting exploration of the communicative potential of kinetic typography for personal communication. Kinedit is informed by systematic study and characterization of a corpus of examples, and iterative involvement and validation by designers throughout the development process. We describe the tool and its underlying technology, usage experiences, lessons learned, and next steps.</abstract>
