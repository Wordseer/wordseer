<abstract>Cameras provide an appealing new input medium for interaction. The creation of camera-based interfaces is outside the skill-set of most programmers and completely beyond the skills of most interface designers. Image Processing with Crayons is a tool for creating new camera-based interfaces using a simple painting metaphor. A transparent layers model is used to present the designer with all of the necessary information. Traditional machine learning algorithms have been modified to accommodate the rapid response time required of an interactive design tool.</abstract>
