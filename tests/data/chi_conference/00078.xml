<abstract>In order to improve the stability of eye cursor, we introduce three methods, force field (FF), speed reduction (SR), and warping to target center (TC) to modulate eye cursor trajectories by counteracting eye jitter, which is the main cause of destabilizing the eye cursor. We evaluate these methods using two controlled experiments. One is an attention task experiment, which indicates that both FF and SR significantly alleviate the instability of eye cursor, but TC is not as we anticipated. The other is a 2D pointing task experiment, which shows that FF and SR as well as the improved implementation of SR (iSR) indeed improve human performance in dominant dwell-based eye pointing tasks of eye-based interactions. The method iSR is especially effective to accelerate eye pointing (10.5\% and 8.5\%) and reduce error rate (6.1\% and 2.7\%) when target diameter D</i> = 45 and 60 pixels.</abstract>
