<abstract>This paper presents a novel middleware for developing flexible interactive multi-surface applications. Using a scenario-based approach, we identify the requirements for this type of applications. We then introduce Substance</i>, a data-oriented framework that decouples functionality from data, and Shared Substance</i>, a middleware implemented in Substance that provides powerful sharing abstractions. We describe our implementation of two applications with Shared Substance</i> and discuss the insights gained from these experiments. Our finding is that the combination of a data-oriented programming model with middleware support for sharing data and functionality provides a flexible, robust solution with low viscosity at both design-time and run-time.</abstract>
