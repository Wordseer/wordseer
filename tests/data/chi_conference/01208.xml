<abstract>Previous research reported interesting gender effects involving specific benefits for females navigating with wider fields of view on large displays. However, it was not clear what was driving the 3D navigation performance gains, and whether or not the effect was more tightly coupled to gender or to spatial abilities. The study we report in this paper replicates and extends previous work, demonstrating that the gender-specific navigation benefits come from the presence of optical flow cues, which are better afforded by wider fields of view on large displays. The study also indicates that the effect may indeed be tied to gender, as opposed to spatial abilities. Together, the findings provide a significant contribution to the HCI community, as we provide strong recommendations for the design and presentation of 3D environments, backed by empirical data. Additionally, these recommendations reliably benefit females, without an accompanying detriment to male navigation performance.</abstract>
