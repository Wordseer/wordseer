<abstract>Prototyping and evaluation combine to explore ways that an effective, integrative organization of project-related information might emerge as a by-product of a person's efforts to plan a project. The Personal Project Planner</i> works as an extension to the file manager -- providing people with rich-text overlays to their information. Document-like project plans provide a context in which to create or reference documents, email messages, web pages, etc. that are needed to complete the plan. The user can later locate an information item such as an email message with reference to the plan (e.g., as an alternative to searching through the inbox or sent mail). Results of an interim evaluation of the Planner are very promising and suggest special directions of focus for limited available prototyping resources.</abstract>
