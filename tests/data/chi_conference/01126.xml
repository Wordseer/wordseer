<abstract>We propose a gaze movement model that enables an embodied interface agent to convey different impressions to users. Managing one's own impression to influence the behaviors of others plays an important role in human communications. To create a new application area which involves agents in this kind of social interaction, interface agents that manage their impressions are required. For this purpose, we build the gaze movement model based on three gaze parameters picked from a large number of psychological studies: amount of gaze</i>, mean duration of gaze</i>, and gaze points while averted</i>. In this paper, we introduce the gaze movement model and gaze parameters. We then present an experiment in which subjects evaluated the impressions created by nine gaze patterns produced by altering the gaze parameters. The results indicate that reproducible relations exist between the gaze parameters and impressions, which shows the validity of the model</abstract>
