<abstract>We describe a social bookmarking service de-signed for a large enterprise. We discuss design principles addressing online identity, privacy, information discovery (including search and pivot browsing), and service extensi-bility based on a web-friendly architectural style. In addi-tion we describe the key design features of our implementa-tion. We provide the results of an eight week field trial of this enterprise social bookmarking service, including a de-scription of user activities, based on log file analysis. We share the results of a user survey focused on the benefits of the service. The feedback from the user trial, comprising survey results, log file analysis and informal communica-tions, is quite positive and suggests several promising en-hancements to the service. Finally, we discuss potential extension and integration of social bookmarking services with other corporate collaborative applications.</abstract>
