<abstract>The utility and impact of a usability evaluation depend on how well its results align with the business goals of the system under evaluation. However, how to achieve such alignment is not well understood. We propose a simple technique that requires active consideration of a system's business goals in planning and reporting evaluations. The technique is tested in an experiment with 44 novice evaluators using think aloud testing. The evaluators considering business goals report fewer usability problems compared to evaluators that did not use the technique. The company commissioning the evaluation, however, assesses those problems 30-42\% higher on four dimensions of utility. We discuss how the findings may generalize to usability professionals, and how the technique may be used in realistic usability evaluations. More generally, we discuss how our results illustrate one of a variety of ways in which business goals and other facets of a system's context may enter into usability evaluations.</abstract>
