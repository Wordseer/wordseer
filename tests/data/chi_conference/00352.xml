<abstract>We analyze microblog posts generated during two recent, concurrent emergency events in North America via Twitter, a popular microblogging service. We focus on communications broadcast by people who were "on the ground" during the Oklahoma Grassfires of April 2009 and the Red River Floods that occurred in March and April 2009, and identify information that may contribute to enhancing situational awareness</i> (SA). This work aims to inform next steps for extracting useful, relevant information during emergencies using information extraction (IE) techniques.</abstract>
